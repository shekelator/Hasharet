This app is a learning experience with Node/Express, Socket.io, and Backbone. A lot, right? I already know some parts of Backbone pretty well, but the others are new.

The app is a simple SPA that allows our synagogue to coordinate volunteer activities, such as reading on Shabbat and watching the little kiddos in the nursery.

Planning to use Hebcal.com to get Shabbat dates and parashot (e.g. http://www.hebcal.com/hebcal/?v=1&cfg=json&nh=on&year=2013&month=11&mf=on&s=on). See http://www.hebcal.com/home/developer-apis for more info.

I'll probably make a royal poop out of this and hopefully rewrite it with Angular, Meteor, or something.
