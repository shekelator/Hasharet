This app is a learning experience with Node/Express, Socket.io, and Backbone. A lot, right? I already know some parts of Backbone pretty well, but the others are new.

The app is a simple SPA that allows our synagogue to coordinate volunteer activities, such as reading on Shabbat and watching the little kiddos in the nursery.

I'll probably make a royal poop out of this and hopefully rewrite it with Angular, Meteor, or something.
